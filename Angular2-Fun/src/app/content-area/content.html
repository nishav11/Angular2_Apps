        Update: I have left the Angular 2.0 team. This happened back in November 2014, shortly after I originally authored this post. As of today, June 5, 2015, there appear to be a number of changes in Angular 2.0 that diverge it from what I show below. Unfortunately,
        I believe those changes bestow additional obscure syntax and even greater complexity on Angular 2.0. The Angular 2.0 team has written very little publicly about any of these details. That said, I left Angular 2.0 to build Aurelia, something that
        I believe is more in line with what the Angular community had hoped for in 2.0. It also draws from the best parts of Durandal and merges these ideas together into a consistent JavaScript application development experience for mobile, desktop and
        web. If you are reading this, I'm sure you will find it exciting like the many Durandal and Angular users who have already moved to Aurelia. You can read the public announcement here.
